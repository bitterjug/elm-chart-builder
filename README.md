# elm-chart-builder
An opinionated and accessible charting library for Elm based on [gampleman/elm-visualization](https://github.com/gampleman/elm-visualization).

The aim of this package is to make it easy to create some basic chart types. 
These charts should be fully accessible, but for now this is still very much a work in progress.

The `Chart.Bar` module is almost feature complete.

The `Chart.Line` module is still a work in progress and has limited functionality.

## Examples:
`cd examples && elm reactor`

Then navigate the examples in the browser.

## Tests:
`elm-test`

## TODO 
* Stacked line charts
* Symbols on line charts
* Alternative table representation 
* Tooltips

## TODO nice to have
* Labels for line charts
