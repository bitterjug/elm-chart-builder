# elm-chart-builder
An opinionated and accessible charting library for Elm based on [gampleman/elm-visualization](https://github.com/gampleman/elm-visualization) and [elm-community/typed-svg](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/typed-svg/latest/).

The aim of this package is to make it easy to create some basic chart types. 
It is an opinionated library, because every charting module represents a very specific charting choice. If your aim is to build some personalized charts not covered here, then you should probably try a more low level library such as `gampleman/elm-visualization`.

All chart modules will be as much accessible as possible, but this is still a work in progress.
